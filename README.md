<H1>Tourism Mangement</H1>
The Tourism Management in C++ project is an application that demonstrates the use of polymorphism and inheritance to manage various aspects of the tourism industry. It allows users to interact with the system to manage bookings, customers, and destinations, showcasing how object-oriented programming principles can be applied to real-world scenarios.

<H1>Features</H1>
Inheritance: The project uses inheritance to create a hierarchy of classes, such as Customer, Package, and display, to represent different tourism components. Each of these classes inherits common properties and methods from a base class.

Polymorphism: Polymorphism is demonstrated by allowing users to interact with the different types of tourism components using a common interface. This means that you can perform operations like booking or listing without worrying about the specific type of tourism component.

Booking Management: The system allows users to create, modify, and cancel bookings for various tourism components. Bookings can be made for specific destinations, accommodations, and activities.

Customer Database: Maintain a database of customer information, including contact details and booking history. Customers can be linked to their respective bookings.

Destination Management: The project demonstrates how different destinations can be represented in an organized manner, showcasing the relationship between destinations and the tourism components available in those destinations.

<H1>Prerequisites</H1>
Before you begin, ensure you have met the following requirements:

A C++ compiler installed on your system (e.g., Visual Studio Code,Dev-C++).

Basic knowledge of C++ programming and object-oriented principles.
